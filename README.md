# Pulse Tickets — Front-end scaffold

This is a front-end only ticketing / booking scaffold (7 pages) built with Bootstrap + custom CSS and vanilla JS.

Pages included:
- index.html — landing with carousel and featured events
- events.html — events listing
- event.html — event detail + booking widget
- checkout.html — checkout form (simulated)
- login.html — sign-in
- signup.html — sign-up
- profile.html — user tickets

Assets:
- `assets/css/styles.css` — global styles & color variables
- `assets/js/main.js` — small interactions

Design notes:
- Color scheme uses CSS variables in `styles.css` (primary and accent).
- Images are hotlinked from Unsplash (free). Replace with downloaded assets if needed.
- No backend — forms are simulated. Integrate with your API to persist users/bookings.

Run / preview:
Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use a simple static server).
